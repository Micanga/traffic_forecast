# All Data Info

This folder contains our main dataset.

The data set UK-Highways is our main source of data in this work. It was built by the Department for Transport of the Government of the United Kingdom. 

The data is publicly available for download, and it includes UK highwaysâ€™ traffic flow values collected from January 2015 to March 2015 by high-fidelity sensors in 2511 junction-to-junction road links at a 15 to 15 minutes interval. 

There are nearly 22.4 million flow values in total. 

Each of the records also provides: the link reference and description; the date of collection; an ID referring to one of the 96 15-minutes intervals within the corresponding day; the average speed of vehicles entering the link, in km/h; the length of the link, in km; the average journey time to travel across the road link, in seconds, and; an indicator of the accuracy of this data item.

So the zips have all data that you need to run the source files and tests.

All data were previously formatted for AdaptFlow application.
