# Effective Forecast of Highway Traffic Flow with Adaptive Computing in Data Streams - Abstract

Real-time traffic forecast is essential to develop and maintain  intelligent  transportation  systems.  Recent  advances  intraffic  sensing  technology  have  enabled  the  acquisition  of  high-fidelity,  spatio-temporal  data  streams  with  a  number  of  traffic parameters,  such  as  traffic  flow.  

The  resulting  streams  are  the basis  for  an  accurate  traffic  forecast,  which  in  turn  improves route navigation, traffic regulation, urban planning, and the like. To forecast future traffic conditions, the existing techniques focus on:  (i)  the  immediate  past  data,  like  the  events  collected  in  the last 15 minutes,  or;  (ii)  the  long-term  past  data,  such  as  theevents  collected  on  the  same  day  of  the  week  and  time  in  the last 10 weeks.  

The  state-of-the-art  techniques  employ  a  hybrid approach,  in  which  the  immediate  past  data  is  used  by  default, but it gives place to the long-term past data right after a sequenceof  in accurate  results.  This  paper  proposes AdaptFlow;  a  novel algorithm  able  to  accurately  forecast  traffic  flow  in  highways by taking advantage of linear regression and historical methods integrated  with  statistical  and  decision  making  techniques.  It  is a  new,  adaptive  approach  that  automatically  defines  how  much the  immediate  and  the  long-term  past  data  should  contributeto  calculate  each  of  the  events  to  be  forecast.  We  performed experiments  on  large  sets  of  traffic  data  from  real  highwaysin   UK   and   USA.   

Our AdaptFlow out performed   well-known related  works,  i.e.,  the  traditional  ARIMA  and  the  state-of-the-art  HARIMA,  on  many  possible  settings.  As  an  example,  our AdaptFlow achieved 95.5% accuracy in average when forecasting the next 15 minutes flow of the UK highways, which is 60% and 29% better  than  ARIMA  and  HARIMA,  respectively.
